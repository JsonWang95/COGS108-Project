    "World of Warcraft (WoW) is a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) created by Blizzard Entertainment. In this context, we wil be focusing on the player versus player (PvP) aspect of the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in determining if having more healers on a team during a battleground increases the chances of that team winning said battleground. Healers take on a support role and mend fellow teammates to help them win the battleground. Due to World of Warcraft's matchmaking system, sometimes there is an imbalance of roles on a certain team, where one team may have 0-1 healers and the opposing side would have 2+ healers. This is a sentiment felt the community and often echoed in battleground chat when playing battlegrounds. We wanted to find out if this is backed by data or if it just feels like more healers on one side increases their chances of winning the battleground."

    "In our research, we aimed to determine whether a team that has more healers is able to increase their winning chances on a battleground. We developed and compared three models containing multiple samples of every character in the game that describes their battleground, code, faction, class, wins and losses. In our first model, we plotted a scatter matrix that is a cumulative representation of our data which has a plot of all of the given data in the dataframe. In our second model, we organized each of the characters by their healing distribution that indicates how much healing they’ve completed. And in our last model, we plotted the number of deaths each character has committed; a healer’s death doesn’t influence their win rate as much as a damage dealer’s win rate. Therefore, healers have more room for error which may explain their higher win rate. Although it’s been generalized frequently that a greater number of healers correlate to a higher chance of winning the game, a few limitations of our analysis include a lack of previous studies in the research area and scope of discussions. With all of our findings, we were able to determine whether or not a greater number of healers on a team is able to increase their chances of winning the game."
